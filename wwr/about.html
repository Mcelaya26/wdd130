            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Wild Current Rafting Co. began in 2014 after founder Caleb Rivers noticed a
                growing
                gap in the rafting industry: plenty of thrill-focused outfitters, but very few
                that
                truly
                supported beginners and families who wanted to learn the river rather than just
                survive
                it.
                Starting with two rafts, a borrowed trailer, and weekends only, Caleb ran trips
                himself
                while Maya helped design safety training and Evan volunteered to manage
                logistics.
                Word
                spread quickly about the company’s patient guides and safety-first approach.
                Within
                three
                seasons, Wild Current expanded into a full-time operation with a dedicated
                training
                program
                and a loyal base of returning guests.
