                <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    To provide safe, empowering, and unforgettable river experiences while
                    fostering
                    respect for wild
                    waterways, teamwork, and personal growth.
                </p>
                <h3>Why They Do What They Do</h3>
                <p>
                    Wild Current believes rivers have a unique way of teaching people—how to
                    trust,
                    how
                    to
                    work
                    together, and how to stay present in moments that matter. The team isn’t
                    just
                    there
                    to
                    guide rafts
                    downstream; they’re there to help people overcome fear, connect with nature,
                    and
                    walk
                    away feeling
                    stronger than when they arrived.

                    For the founders and guides, rafting isn’t about conquering the river—it’s
                    about
                    learning to move
                    with it. They do what they do because they’ve seen how a single day on the
                    water
                    can
                    change how
                    someone sees themselves, their limits, and the world around them.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Wild Current Rafting Co. began in 2014 after founder Caleb Rivers noticed a
                growing
                gap in the rafting industry: plenty of thrill-focused outfitters, but very few
                that
                truly
                supported beginners and families who wanted to learn the river rather than just
                survive
                it.
                Starting with two rafts, a borrowed trailer, and weekends only, Caleb ran trips
                himself
                while Maya helped design safety training and Evan volunteered to manage
                logistics.
                Word
                spread quickly about the company’s patient guides and safety-first approach.
                Within
                three
                seasons, Wild Current expanded into a full-time operation with a dedicated
                training
                program
                and a loyal base of returning guests.
