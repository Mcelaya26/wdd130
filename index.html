        <p>
            My name is Michael Celaya, and I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Software
            Development
            at BYU. I have a strong interest in problem-solving, writing clean and efficient code,
            and
            continuously improving my technical skills through hands-on learning and projects. I
            live in
            Providence, Utah, where I enjoy life with my wonderful family, including our two boys, a
            lively
            flock of chickens, and a few cats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I enjoy building and tinkering—whether that’s 3D printing,
            woodworking,
            constructing and flying drones, or even building my own guitar. I also play the guitar
            and enjoy
            creative, hands-on projects that blend technical thinking with craftsmanship. When I’m
            not building
            something, you’ll likely find me outdoors with my sons hiking, fishing, or camping. I
            have a deep
            interest in astronomy and enjoy spending clear nights exploring the sky with my
            telescope.

        <p>
            Utah is a western U.S. state known for its dramatic landscapes, including deserts,
            mountain ranges, and five national parks often called the “Mighty 5.” It sits at a
            geographic crossroads—bordering six states—and is especially famous for outdoor
            recreation, from skiing in the Wasatch Mountains to hiking in red-rock canyons.
