            My name is Michael Celaya, and I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Software
            Development
            at BYU. I have a strong interest in problem-solving, writing clean and efficient code,
            and continuously improving my technical skills through hands-on learning and projects.

            Utah is a western U.S. state known for its dramatic landscapes, including deserts, mountain ranges, and five national parks often called the “Mighty 5.” It sits at a geographic crossroads—bordering six states—and is especially famous for outdoor recreation, from skiing in the Wasatch Mountains to hiking in red-rock canyons.
